    <h1>Iraj Madhav Bastakoti</h1>


    <h3>Hello, I am Iraj Madhav Bastakoti. I am from Pokhara, Nepal. I just completed Grade 8 and am going to Grade 9. I am 13 years old and my birthday is on April 1st, meaning that in a few days, I will turn 14. I study in SOS Hermann Gmiener School Gandaki which is neither a government school nor a private school but rather an international non-profit organization. My height is 159 cm or 5 foot 2 inches. My hobby is playing football. I joined this class because I wanted to learn what coding was all about and test how much was interested in it. This could even help me decide my career.</h3>


    <h4>That was a short introduction about me. Hope you enjoyed reading it.</h4>
