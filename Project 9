<h1>SOS Hermann Gmiener School Gandaki</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>SOS Hermann Gmeiner School Gandaki is a well-known educational institution located in Rambazar, Pokhara, Nepal. Established in 1982, the school was founded to provide education for children from SOS Children’s Village Gandaki, especially those who lost their homes during a massive landslide in Kaski and Syangja districts in 1980. Over the years, the school has expanded to include students from the local community, offering classes from Nursery to Grade 12. Its peaceful location and strong academic foundation make it one of the most respected schools in the region.</p>
